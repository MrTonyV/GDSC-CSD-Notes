# GDSC-CSD-Notes
A simple note-taking app built with Jetpack Compose for the "Intro to Android dev" GDSC UoC event! See [our Google Developer Student Clubs UoC event platform](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-crete/)

## Branch outlines
There are four branches, each one representing a significant milestone in this sample's development. In the event, we will begin our development from `step-1-room-setup` which contains all the necessary dependencies for our project, as well as the basic
database setup for our app's needs. We will then slowly build out the UI for the two main screens (a screen for adding new notes & one for displaying them in a simple list) and finally move on to writing the business logic through ViewModels &
repositories!

## Architecture
This sample "follows" vaguely a simple MVVM architecture.
